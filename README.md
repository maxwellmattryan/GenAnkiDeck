# GenAnkiDeck

GenAnkiDeck is a script that automates the creation of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) decks. It saves a considerable amount of time by reading data from a table and properly assigning it to user-specified fields within a user-specified note type. This is extremely useful for creating decks of 100+ cards in a matter of seconds - something that could take hours by doing manually.

Example Anki packages can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xLogtFY8FB_CCMpatZO90ZUDCkakqrQn?usp=sharing).

## Libraries 

You will need to install the following libraries in order to run the script.

```
pip install genanki xlrd
```
